Drummer and producer Bård Berg is a former student from the Norwegian Academy of Music where he studied Jazz Drums. During his studies, he discovered his love for electronic music and released his first album in 2019, called Oslo Beats. The album holds several collaborations with his fellow classmates and was inspired by his love for his home base of Oslo, Norway. As Bård stated in a video interview with the Diamond Club about Oslo Beats, it “ended up being so many different things, reflecting back on how Oslo is - there is so much diversity in such a small city.
