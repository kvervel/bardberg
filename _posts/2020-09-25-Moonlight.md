Norwegian rising-star shines on evocative and immersive new double single
Having become a fixture of Oslo’s electronic scene over the past few years Bård Berg further enhanced his reputation on Friday as one of the city’s most innovative producers with his faultless new double single ‘Moonlight / Swipe’. His debut album (2019’s simply-titled ‘Oslo Beats’) established his unique sound, and ever since he’s gradually evolved into Oslo’s answer to the modern wave of house artists mixing fluid, smooth beats with sharp pop instincts. His late-2019 release ‘Addicted’ hinted at this more mature and pop-leaning direction and this is only further evidenced by the quality shown on his two newest tracks.
Speaking on the songs, Berg says: “On ‘Moonlight’ I try to capture both sides of the night, the quiet, mystical one and the groovy club vibe. ‘Swipe’ is about getting carried away by the feeling of potential when you meet someone new, realizing they’re shit and then you dump them (and go back to the swiping)”.
Berg’s knack for finding the right collaborators to augment his music has always been a feature of his work and these two songs are lit up by guest slots from two other rising Norwegian artists, Bethany Forseth-Reichberg of art-rock band Mall Girl and Liva Austad Sværen of pop duo Soft Punch. A-side ‘Moonlight’ is a mellow, shape-shifting song, with Forseth-Reichberg’s vocal giving the song a wistful but enigmatic soul and expansive, sparse verses giving way to the Noughties-inflected disco of the explosive choruses. ‘Swipe’ is more aggressive and dynamic, with Sværen’s relatable lyrics about the pitfalls of modern dating set amongst a sonic world of fleet-footed, acrobatic house.
The double single aptly shows Berg’s mastery of his craft and attention to detail, with both songs ably providing the soundtrack to 2 am dancefloors and late evening chill alike. A memorable and powerful pair of tracks from one of Norway’s most in-demand talents.
’Moonlight / Swipe’ is out now via GEMS.
