To B featuring the fantastic bedroom pop artist Solå.
While often laid back, Bård Berg uses the track to dial back the funkier aspects of his disco house and turns "To B" into a smooth hip hop jam, with Solå's lighter-than-air voice transporting us to west coast USA and bathing in the summer sun.

"I remember I came across Solå's song 'Dizzy' and got really hooked, and it made me get in touch with her to ask if we should make some music together," says Berg. "We met in the studio and ended up working on a song Sol had started on before. The instrumental is a combination between what Sol had worked with and a very tough hip hop beat I had made earlier but did not find out what I was going to use it for."

Solå reveals that "To B" was one of the first tracks she wrote for her solo project back in 2018, but it had previously not moved beyond the demo stage. "'To B' is about the process of becoming comfortable around someone in a more intimate way," she explains, "and also about the process of letting go of fear, to let yourself feel the most warm and embracing feelings with another human being."
