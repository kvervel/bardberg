"Barcode" by Bård Berg is a stunning piece of Nordic jazz house, where a magnificent bassline warms even the coldest days, and a fairy-tale-like trumpet glides effortlessly through the track. Blending disco house energy with sophisticated grooves, the Norwegian drummer, DJ, and producer continues his journey from jazz to electronic mastery. Following the critically acclaimed Oslo Beats series, this new single cements Bård Berg’s reputation for crafting elegant, dancefloor-ready music.
